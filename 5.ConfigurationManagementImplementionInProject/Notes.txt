153. Download the Jar file (ConfigServer) and add in project and In main class EnableConfigServer with Annotation

Here we need to move all the services application.yml file to configserver service and we need change some properties in yml as follows.

Here we remove the configuration for al individual service and just add application.yml name so that , in config service as we saved the yml with name like order-service.yml etc..it will fetch the configuration .

# we need to fetch the configuration , we need to specify path in respective application.yml

We need to add config client dependecy to all three services

155. Externalize configuration using .env file or environment variable - I didn't do
replacing credentials and adding deatils .env - adding path in environment variable 

156.Dynamic refresh to avoid restart the application using actuator

first we need to add necessary dependency actuator and amqp in pom.xml for three services.

We need to add the credentials for rabbitmq and properties for actuator in each services (means in configserver)


didn't run - we need to install RabbitMQ in docker
